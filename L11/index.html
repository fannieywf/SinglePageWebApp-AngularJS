    <!-- Expression: {{exp}}, something that evaluates to some value
    processed by Angular & roughly similar to the result of eval(some_js)
    executed in the context of the scope & has access to properties on $scope
    Does not throw errors if it returns in a TypeError or ReferenceError
    Control flow functions (e.g. "if" statements, etc.) are not allowed
    Accept a filter or a filter chain to format the output -->
    <!-- Interpolation, process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, which are replaced with values
    In Angular, this string: Message is {{message}} (provided message = "hello") is interpolated into this string:
    Message is hello.
    Still connected to the original message property. If $scope.message changes, so will the interpolation result -->
